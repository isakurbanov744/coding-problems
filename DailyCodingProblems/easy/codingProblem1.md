# Coding Problem 

Given a list of numbers, return whether any two sums to `k`. For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k` of `17`, return true since `10 + 7` is `17`.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

# Explanation

For this simple problem, two for loops can be used to determine if two numbers in an array will sum up to `k`. This will make the complexity `O(n^2)`
